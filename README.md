## ACES Wild Mud Server 1\.0, BETA B


</div>

### Description

This is beta version b of my new mud codebase. This release has the following new features: o ANSI Colour Support (Thanks to the Creator of BeMud for this)   o Help System Support   o Better Server GUI, Including a connection manager   o Hard-coded socials support   o Many minor bug fixes   o Chat and Say commands              I am having one major problem, and cannot find a fix. When a user uses the chat or say commands, the other users do not receive there message until they use a command (E.G., I type 'say test', the other person in the room will not get it until they type 'look') If anyone has a fix for this PLEASE contact me.
